# Openslide

OpenSlide is an Open-Source Camera Slider build with cost effective and well available components

## Protocol

Idea of communication between Arduino and Node JS Webserver

COMMAND:val1=10,val=10  
SET_POS:start=10,end=100  
  
RES 
OK: data=1,data=1

## Ideas

- Repeat Mode (Slider cycles throw points until stop)
